## Question 7
> [Q7] Generate a sequence identity based heatmap of your aligned sequences using R. If necessary convert your sequence alignment to the ubiquitous FASTA format (Seaview can read in clustal format and “Save as” FASTA format for example). Read this FASTA format alignment into R with the help of functions in the Bio3D package. Calculate a sequence identity matrix (again using a function within the Bio3D package). Then generate a heatmap plot and add to your report. Do make sure your labels are visible and not cut at the figure margins.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
library(pheatmap)
aln <- read.fasta("cluster.fasta")
iden <- seqidentity(aln)
pheatmap(iden, margins = c(12,12))
```

## Question 8

> [Q8] Using R/Bio3D (or an online blast server if you prefer), search the main protein structure database for the most similar atomic resolution structures to your aligned sequences. List the top 3 unique hits (i.e. not hits representing different chains from the same structure) along with their Evalue and sequence identity to your query. Please also add annotation details of these structures. For example include the annotation terms PDB identifier (structureId), Method used to solve the structure (experimentalTechnique), resolution (resolution), and source organism (source).


Use the sequence with the highest identity
```{r}
rowmean <- rowMeans(iden)
rowmean
highest.name <- names(which.max(rowmean))
highest.val <- max(rowMeans(iden))*100
print(paste("The species with the highest average row identity is", highest.name))
print(paste("The average row identity of this species is", round(highest.val,2), "%"))
```
Now we will continue with the FASTA of the turtle

```{r}
turtle <- read.fasta("turtle.fasta")
turtle.blast <- blast.pdb(turtle)
```

```{r}
# top 3 hits ID
library(dplyr)
df.blast <- turtle.blast$hit.tbl
df.blast.id <- head(df.blast$subjectids,3)

df.eval.iden <- select(head(df.blast,3), c("evalue","identity"))
rownames(df.eval.iden) <- as.vector(select(head(df.blast,3),"subjectids"))[1:3,]

df.eval.iden

```


```{r}
df.pdb <- lapply(df.blast.id,pdb.annotate) %>% bind_rows()
df.pdb.select <- select(df.pdb, c("structureId","experimentalTechnique","resolution","source"))
df.pdb.select
```
Now we can combine our two dataframes

```{r}
df.final <- cbind(df.eval.iden, df.pdb.select)
colnames(df.final) <- c("Evalue", "Identity", "ID", "Technique", "Resolution", "Source")
df.final
```


## Question 9
> [Q9] Generate a molecular figure of one of your identified PDB structures using VMD. You can optionally highlight conserved residues that are likely to be functional. Please use a white or transparent background for your figure (i.e. not the default black). Based on sequence similarity. How likely is this structure to be similar to your “novel” protein?

Based on the sequence similarity, this is very likely to be similar in structure to my novel protein Pinctada maxima due to the high sequence similarity (>91%).

## Question 10

> [Q10] Perform a “Target” search of ChEMBEL ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ ) with your novel sequence. Are there any Target Associated Assays and ligand efficiency data reported that may be useful starting points for exploring potential inhibition of your novel protein?

CHEMBL details 3 Binding Assays (CHEMBL3707846, CHEMBL3707845,CHEMBL3705836 -- all the same) and 1 Inhibition Asssay (CHEMBL3887722); No ligand efficiency data.

In the binding assay they tested the affinity of various compounds at the NE, DA and 5HT transporters of HEK293E cell lines. There are no references provided or useful information.
